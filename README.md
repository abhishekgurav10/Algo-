back_end code 
we have created the basic back_end and fron-end is too basic we have just create it to check whether the values is displays or not.
If you wanna to refer the code then go ahead and you can implement as well but just keep an eye on it because there are some error that needs to be solved 
And we have created it for single user but till this friday we will complete the code and update it then you can use it freely without tension 
And you need to do the redis setup we have use the redis in the docker so plz see the vedio on youtube and then use the redis
